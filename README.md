# Citizen Engagement System (MVP)

A full-stack web application that allows citizens to submit complaints or feedback on public services. Government institutions can review, respond, and track the status of each complaint through an admin interface.

This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) developed to improve transparency, responsiveness, and engagement between citizens and public service providers.
